  <p>
    The rise of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence</a> 
    is reshaping how education is delivered worldwide. It helps create smarter classrooms 
    where learning can be tailored to individual needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teachers now use <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/machine-learning/" target="_blank">machine learning</a> 
    tools to analyze performance data and track progress. This helps identify areas where 
    students need more support.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the power of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/natural-language-processing" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing</a>, 
    AI chatbots and assistants can answer student questions instantly, giving them support 
    even outside the classroom.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics/" target="_blank">Ethics</a> 
    is a major concern. Issues like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-data-privacy/" target="_blank">data privacy</a> 
    and algorithmic fairness must be addressed to ensure safe and equal access.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond that, AI can power <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/augmented-reality.asp" target="_blank">Augmented Reality</a> 
    and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/virtual-reality" target="_blank">Virtual Reality</a> 
    technologies, creating immersive experiences that make learning more engaging.
